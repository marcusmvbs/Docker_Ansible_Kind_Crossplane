This project consists on provisioning cloud infrastructure, like S3 Buckets on AWS cloud services, via Crossplane on Kubernetes in Docker (Kind) approach. It intends to encourage those who desire to grasp some kubernetes skills, running on local machine. 

To execute it, Windows 11 and Docker Desktop were adopted to run the cluster's project.

The complete path to build a system like that, requires you to understand the following components in priority:
Docker > Ansible > Kind cluster > Crossplane > AWS Credentials > AWS S3 Bucket

Some most used helm repos were kept as comments, as well as their install commands, to be tested in future developments.
